This repository contains the content for my technical blog, [The Flat
Trantor Society](http://the-flat-trantor-society.blogspot.com/).

I initially composed the articles using blogspot's own
tools, which don't (as far as I can tell) allow for using
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

I've now copied the contents of the first two posts and manually
converted them to Markdown format.  For any future posts, I'll first
compose them as Markdown, then copy-and-paste the generated HTML
into blogspot.

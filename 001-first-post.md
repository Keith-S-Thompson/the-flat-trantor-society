Greetings to my vast army of followers.

This is my new blog, in which I will sporadically post rants and
musings on software development, programming language standards,
and whatever else strikes my fancy at the moment.

Welcome.

[I've decided "The Flat [Trantor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor)
Society" is a cooler name.  I'll post some actual content Real
Soon Now.]
